# Calculator
**Project Title: Interactive Calculator**

**Project Description:**

The Interactive Calculator project is a functional web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to create a simple, user-friendly calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application is designed to be intuitive, with a clean layout and responsive features for a seamless user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Key Features:**
1. **Basic Arithmetic Operations:** The calculator supports fundamental operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
2. **Clear and Reset Functions:** It includes a "Clear" button to reset the current calculation and a "Reset" button to clear all inputs and start fresh.
3. **Responsive Design:** The layout is fully responsive, making the calculator accessible and easy to use on a variety of screen sizes, from smartphones to desktops.
4. **Error Handling:** The app displays error messages for invalid operations (like dividing by zero), ensuring users are informed when something goes wrong.
5. **Button Interaction:** The buttons are designed to be large and easy to click or tap, with clear labels for each operation, making it ideal for touch-based devices.
6. **Decimal and Negative Number Support:** Users can input decimal values and negative numbers, expanding the calculatorâ€™s usability for more complex operations.

**Technologies Used:**
- **HTML** for structuring the interface, including buttons and display sections.
- **CSS** for styling the calculator, including layouts, colors, and responsive design elements.
- **JavaScript** for the core functionality of the calculator, handling user input, performing calculations, and updating the display dynamically.

**Objective:** 
- To build a functional and interactive web application using basic web technologies.
- To practice JavaScript DOM manipulation and event handling.
- To create a responsive design that ensures usability across different devices and screen sizes.
- To implement simple error handling and provide a smooth user experience.

This project can be used as a practical tool for learning or for everyday calculations, and it serves as a great starting point for understanding JavaScript operations and user interface design.
